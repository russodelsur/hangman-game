## How to play

Hangman is a word-guessing game. The computer picks a secret word, and the player tries to guess it. When the guessing player guesses a letter that isn't in the word, they lose a point and the first player draws part of a stick- man for each wrong guess.

You will have 10 attempts to get the full word before losing the round. The app will count the apps lost and won, and will allow you to restart the game from 0 at any moment. 

## How to use Hangman?

Open your terminal and then type

$ git clone {the url to the GitHub repo}

This clones the repo

Or download the folder directly from github

cd into the new folder and type

$ npm install

This installs the required dependencies

To run the React project.
$ npm start

#### Enjoy!
